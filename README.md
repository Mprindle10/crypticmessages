# Cryptic Message Subscription Service

This project is a full-stack web application for sending cryptic messages to subscribers via SMS and email. Users pay a $15/month subscription fee to receive three cryptic messages each week. Each message requires the previous week's code to solve, and the difficulty increases over time.

- SMS: Twilio
- Email: SendGrid
- Payments: Stripe

## Features
