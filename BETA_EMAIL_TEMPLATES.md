Hi [Name],

I've been working on something that I think you'd absolutely love, and I want to give you exclusive early access.

It's called **The Cipher Academy Journey** - a 21-month adventure through 5,000 years of cryptography, from ancient Spartan military codes to cutting-edge quantum security.

**Why I thought of you:**
[Personal connection - "your work in cybersecurity", "your love of puzzles", "your CS background"]

**What makes this special:**
- Tri-weekly challenges that build on each other
- Real historical ciphers used by spies, military, and mathematicians
- Progressive difficulty from beginner to expert level
- The same techniques that broke Enigma and secure modern banking

I'm looking for 50 beta testers to experience the first month free and help me refine the experience before the public launch.

**Beta perks:**
‚úÖ Free first month (normally $19.99)
‚úÖ Lifetime 50% discount if you continue
‚úÖ Direct line to provide feedback
‚úÖ Recognition as a founding member

Would you be interested in being one of the first to crack these codes?

Just reply "I'm in" and I'll send you the first challenge Sunday.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. The first cipher uses a technique Julius Caesar employed to communicate with his generals. Think you can crack it? üòâ

üîê Calling all cybersecurity professionals and puzzle enthusiasts!

I'm launching something unique: The Cipher Academy Journey - a 21-month deep dive into cryptographic history that builds real analytical skills.

From Caesar ciphers to quantum cryptography, each challenge builds on the last, creating an interconnected learning experience that mirrors how cryptographic knowledge actually developed.

Looking for 50 beta testers to experience the first month free. Perfect for:
‚Ä¢ Cybersecurity professionals wanting cryptanalytic foundations
‚Ä¢ CS students studying cryptography  
‚Ä¢ History buffs fascinated by secret communications
‚Ä¢ Anyone who loves challenging puzzles

Title: [Beta] Historical Cryptography Learning Journey - Looking for 50 testers

Hey r/cryptography!

I've built something I think this community would appreciate: a structured 21-month journey through cryptographic history with progressive challenges.

**The concept:** Tri-weekly messages (Sun/Wed/Fri) with historically accurate ciphers, starting with ancient techniques and building to modern cryptanalysis. Each week requires the previous solution to unlock - mimicking how cryptographic knowledge actually developed.

**Why it's different:**
- University-level curriculum with practical challenges
- Real historical context (not just academic theory)  
- Progressive difficulty that builds genuine skill
- Community of learners solving together

Looking for 50 beta testers for the first month (normally $19.99, free for beta).

If you're interested in being among the first to crack codes used by everyone from Roman generals to WWII codebreakers, comment below!

Examples of upcoming challenges:
- Week 1: Caesar cipher (Roman military communications)
- Week 4: Alberti disk (Renaissance polyalphabetic)  
- Week 8: Playfair (British diplomatic cipher)

üßµ 1/7 I'm launching something for crypto nerds and puzzle lovers...

The Cipher Academy Journey: 21 months through 5,000 years of secret messages.

Looking for 50 beta testers. Thread on what makes this different ‚¨áÔ∏è

2/7 Most crypto education is either:
‚ùå Purely academic (boring theory)
‚ùå Modern-only (missing the foundation)
‚ùå Random puzzles (no progression)

We built something different...

3/7 Progressive challenges that BUILD on each other.

Week 1: Caesar cipher (Roman military)
Week 4: Uses Caesar knowledge + new technique  
Week 8: Combines everything learned so far

Just like how cryptographic knowledge actually developed.

4/7 Real historical context:
üèõÔ∏è Ancient: Spartan scytales, Caesar ciphers
üé® Renaissance: Alberti disks, Vigen√®re squares
‚öîÔ∏è Wars: Enigma, Purple machine
üíª Modern: RSA, quantum cryptography

5/7 Beta testers get:
‚úÖ Free first month (normally $19.99)
‚úÖ 50% lifetime discount
‚úÖ Direct founder access
‚úÖ Founding member recognition

Perfect for security pros, CS students, history buffs, puzzle lovers.

6/7 Quick test: Can you crack this Caesar cipher?
