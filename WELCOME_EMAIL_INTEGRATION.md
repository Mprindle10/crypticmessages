# Welcome Email Series - Database Integration Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The welcome email series has been fully integrated into your Cipher Academy database and backend system. This creates an automated 7-email onboarding sequence that delivers over 14 days, featuring interactive cipher challenges and progressive engagement.

## 📊 Database Schema

### New Tables Created:

1. **`email_templates`** - Stores reusable email content
2. **`welcome_email_series`** - Configuration for the 7-email sequence  
3. **`user_welcome_emails`** - Tracks individual email delivery status
4. **`user_email_preferences`** - User email subscription settings
5. **`email_challenge_submissions`** - Challenge solutions from emails

### Automatic Triggers:

- **`trigger_schedule_welcome_emails`** - Automatically schedules all 7 emails when a user signs up
- **Email tracking functions** - Handle SendGrid webhook events
- **Challenge validation** - Validates cipher solutions from emails

## 🚀 Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Fix PostgreSQL authentication (if needed)
./fix_postgresql_auth.sh

# 2. Run the database setup
./setup_welcome_emails.sh

# 3. Verify the installation
PGPASSWORD='Prindle#$%10' psql -h localhost -U m -d theriddleroom -c "SELECT count(*) FROM email_templates;"
```

## 🔗 DBeaver Integration

### Connection Settings:
```
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: theriddleroom
Username: m
Password: Prindle#$%10
JDBC URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/theriddleroom
Driver: PostgreSQL (auto-download when testing connection)
```

### Database Status After Setup:
✅ **Authentication Fixed** - User 'm' can connect with password  
✅ **Core Tables** - users, cryptic_messages, user_progress, user_submissions  
✅ **Welcome Email Tables** - email_templates, welcome_email_series, user_welcome_emails  
✅ **Ready for DBeaver** - Visual database management and queries

## 📊 Analytics & Tracking

### Email Metrics Tracked:
- Scheduled, sent, delivered, opened, clicked
- Challenge submission rates
- Solution accuracy rates
- Conversion to paid plans

### Performance Queries:
```sql
-- Overall email performance
SELECT * FROM get_pending_welcome_emails();

-- User progress through series
SELECT 
    email_sequence,
    COUNT(*) as users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN opened_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as opened,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN clicked_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as clicked
FROM user_welcome_emails 
GROUP BY email_sequence;

-- Challenge completion rates
SELECT 
    email_sequence,
    challenge_type,
    COUNT(*) as submissions,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN is_correct THEN 1 END) as correct
FROM email_challenge_submissions 
GROUP BY email_sequence, challenge_type;
```

## 🔗 Frontend Integration

### Challenge Submission Form:
```javascript
// Submit cipher solution
const submitChallenge = async (solution) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/welcome-emails/challenge-submission', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            user_id: currentUser.id,
            email_sequence: 1,
            challenge_type: 'caesar',
            solution: solution
        })
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    if (result.is_correct) {
        showSuccess("Correct! Well done on solving the cipher.");
    } else {
        showError("Not quite right. Try again!");
    }
};
```

### Progress Dashboard:
```javascript
// Get user's welcome email progress
const getProgress = async (userId) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/welcome-emails/user/${userId}/progress`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    data.welcome_progress.forEach(email => {
        console.log(`Email ${email.email_sequence}: ${email.status}`);
        console.log(`Challenge completed: ${email.challenge_completed}`);
    });
};
```
